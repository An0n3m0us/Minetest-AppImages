# MinetestAppimage

AppImages for Minetest 5.0.1 for 32bit and 64bit! Both client and server AppImages provided. Tested on a fresh installation of Ubuntu Xenial 16.04, 32 and 64 bit.

Download it from the releases page! Then, make the AppImage an executable by using `chmod +x <file>` in the terminal or by right-clicking the file then selecting "Properties" then "Permissions", and checking the executable checkbox. Double-click the AppImage to run Minetest.

The directory used by these Minetest AppImages is $HOME/.minetest/ so you may place your mods, games and texture packs in there.

Please let me know if you encounter any errors. Report them on the issues page.

Credit to [Calinou](https://forum.minetest.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=194) for the x64 Appimages he created. I used the libraries from them.
