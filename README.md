# Minetest-AppImages

AppImages for Minetest dev builds in 32 bit[^1] and 64bit! Both client and server are in the same executable.

Tested on fresh installations from the oldest releases to the newest releases tested:

路 Ubuntu (Zesty 17.04, Mantic 23.10)

路 Fedora (33, 39)

路 OpenSUSE (Leap 15.5, Tumbleweed 20231219)

路 Archlinux (Manjaro 23.1.0)

[^1]: Halted unless a need for i386 arises as it requires extra work to compile, test and manage libraries

All of the releases in between should work too.

Please let me know if you encounter any errors. Report them on the issues page.

## Running
Download the AppImages from the release page! Then, make the AppImage an executable by entering `chmod +x $FILE` in a terminal or by right-clicking the file then selecting "Properties" then "Permissions", and checking the executable checkbox. Then, double-click the AppImage to run Minetest.

The directory used by the Minetest AppImages is `$HOME/.minetest/` so you may place your mods, games and texture packs in there.

To run a Minetest server, enter this command in a terminal:

`$PATH_TO_APPIMAGE/Minetest-$VERSION-$ARCH.AppImage --server`

## Setting up Minetest on your system globally
(i.e running minetest from the terminal with `minetest`)

First, rename the AppImage to minetest-$VERSION or just minetest; eg: minetest-5.1.1

Move the AppImage to $HOME/bin/ then open a terminal and enter `minetest-$VERSION` or `minetest`. Minetest should now launch.

You can now create a launcher in the applications menu to launch it.
