# MinetestAppimage

Appimage for Minetest 5.0.1 (only x64 available at the moment). Tested on a fresh installation of Ubuntu Xenial 16.04.

Credit to [Calinou](https://forum.minetest.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=194) for the Appimages he created. I used the libraries from them.

If you have any information on building Minetest for i386, let me know!
