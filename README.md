# MinetestAppimage

Appimage for Minetest 5.0.1 (only x64 available at the moment). Tested on a fresh installation of Ubuntu Xenial 16.04.

Download it from the releases page! Then, make the AppImage an executable by using `chmod +x <file>` in the terminal or by right-clicking the file then selecting "Properties" then "Permissions", and checking the executable checkbox. Double-click the AppImage to run Minetest.

Please let me know if you encounter any errors. Report them on the issues page.

Credit to [Calinou](https://forum.minetest.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=194) for the Appimages he created. I used the libraries from them.

If you have any information on building Minetest for i386, let me know! I'll be making a server build soon!
