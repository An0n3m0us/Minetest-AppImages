# Minetest-AppImages

AppImages for Minetest 5.0.1+ for 32bit and 64bit! Both client and server are in the same executable.

Tested on fresh installations from the oldest release it works on to the newest release tested:
(All of the releases in between should work too)

路 Ubuntu (Trusty 14.04, Eoan 19.10)

路 Fedora (30, 31)

路 OpenSUSE (Leap 15, Tumbleweed)

路 Archlinux (Manjaro 19.0.2)

## Running
Download the AppImages from the release page! Then, make the AppImage an executable by entering `chmod +x $FILE` in a terminal or by right-clicking the file then selecting "Properties" then "Permissions", and checking the executable checkbox. Then, double-click the AppImage to run Minetest.

The directory used by the Minetest AppImages is `$HOME/.minetest/` so you may place your mods, games and texture packs in there.

To run a Minetest server, enter this command in a terminal:

`$PATH_TO_APPIMAGE/Minetest-$VERSION-$ARCH.AppImage --server`

## Setting up Minetest on your system globally
(i.e running minetest from the terminal with `minetest`)

First, rename the AppImage to minetest-$VERSION or just minetest; eg: minetest-5.1.1

Move the AppImage to $HOME/bin/ then open a terminal and enter `minetest-$VERSION` or `minetest`. Minetest should now launch.

You can now create a launcher in the applications menu to launch it.
